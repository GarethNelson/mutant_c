currently this is all a big messy hack, don't even try to use it - consider it a work in progress

for every character input:
    if left arrow, go back one character to the left
    if right arrow and not at end of line, go one character right
    if enter:
       if expression is complete, trigger callback
       otherwise, append newline to string along with autoindent stuff
